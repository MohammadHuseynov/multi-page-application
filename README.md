# Multi-Page Application

This is a **multi-page web application** (MPA) where each page is its own route / view.  
Unlike a SPA, navigation will cause full page loads, but each page can contain its own logic, layout, and data fetching.  

The project demonstrates how to structure a website with multiple pages, manage routing, and implement page-specific features.
